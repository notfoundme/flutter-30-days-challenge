#News App with Flutter and Bloc
Today, at day 1, I created a news Application using Flutter.
I learned about the bloc pattern for state management which is summarized below:
1.  State => They are emitted by the bloc
2.  Event =>  They are triggered by the UI.

When an event occurs, its the responsibility of bloc to produce appropriate state and the state can also contains data or error messages. 
The UI uses the `BlocBuilder` to consume the state and data produced by bloc.
